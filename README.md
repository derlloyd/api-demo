    etfs: [{
        ticker: "ABC",
        name: "iShares ABC"
    }, {
        ticker: "XYZ",
        name: "vanguard XYZ"
    }],
    advisors: [{
        name: "derek",

Your assignment is to create a REST API with bearer authentication and 2 collections, 
and to create a Java or Angular.js client (web app) that connects to that REST API, 
pushes new items and reads them afterwards.

As a last step, create an independent html page that uses Javascript / jQuery 
to login to the REST API, add a new product 
and request details from one of those added products

Once completed, simply send back the page you created and we will follow up with you!
